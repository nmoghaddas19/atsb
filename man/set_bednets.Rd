\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to distribute bed nets}

\item{retention}{the average number of timesteps a net is kept for}

\item{dn0}{a matrix of death probabilities for each species over time.
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{rn}{a matrix of repelling probabilities for each species over time
With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

With nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species)}

\item{gamman}{a vector of bednet half-lives for each distribution timestep}
}
\description{
The model will distribute bed nets at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who already have bed nets.

All of the sample "use" their bed nets on the timestep after they are
distributed. Incomplete usage is not part of this model.

If a human in the sample already has a bed net, their bed net will be replaced
by a new one.

Bed nets will be randomly removed each timestep with a rate of \code{1 - exp(-1/retention)}

The structure for the bed net model is documented in the
S.I. of 10.1038/s41467-018-07357-w
